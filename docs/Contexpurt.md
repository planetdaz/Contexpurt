**Title:** Contexpurt: An Interactive Context Building Tool for Large Language Models

---

### **Abstract**
Contexpurt is a powerful, versatile tool designed to optimize interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing a dynamic and interactive context-building environment. It enables users to craft precise, relevant prompts for diverse applications, including querying codebases, managing personal knowledge bases, and handling work-related repositories. With features like folder and tag management, AI-generated document summaries, iterative search and expansion, and persistent context storage, Contexpurt bridges the gap between raw data and meaningful LLM interactions.

### **Introduction**
Modern LLMs like OpenAI’s GPT models excel at providing insights, generating code, and answering questions, but their effectiveness heavily depends on the quality and relevance of the context provided. In large repositories of data, such as extensive codebases or personal knowledge bases, retrieving and assembling the appropriate context is often cumbersome and time-consuming.

Contexpurt addresses this challenge by offering a structured yet flexible platform for assembling, refining, and managing context dynamically. It ensures users can interact effectively with LLMs while maintaining efficiency and precision.

### **Features**

#### **1. Folder and Tag Management**
- **Folder Support:**
  - Upload and organize files into virtual folders.
  - Enable or disable specific folders for inclusion in context searches.
- **Tags:**
  - Apply user-defined or AI-generated tags to documents for efficient filtering and retrieval.

#### **2. AI-Generated Metadata**
- **Summarization:**
  - Generate concise summaries for uploaded documents to provide an overview of their content.
- **Automatic Tagging:**
  - Automatically extract and assign keywords to documents for improved searchability.

#### **3. Iterative Search and Expansion**
- **Semantic Search:**
  - Use embeddings to retrieve relevant chunks of data based on a user-entered query.
- **Context Expansion:**
  - Dynamically expand retrieved results by including neighboring chunks before or after the selected text.
  - Allow users to uncheck irrelevant chunks and reassemble the context.

#### **4. Interactive Context Builder**
- **Context Assembly:**
  - Users can assemble context dynamically by selecting, reordering, and refining chunks of text.
- **Real-Time Preview:**
  - Display the evolving prompt in a live preview window for validation.
- **Exclude Unrelated Content:**
  - Allow users to exclude irrelevant chunks using checkboxes or drag-and-drop removal.

#### **5. Persistent Context Storage**
- **Save Contexts:**
  - Save assembled contexts for reuse in future queries.
- **Versioning:**
  - Maintain a version history of saved contexts, allowing users to revisit and refine past prompts.

#### **6. LLM Integration**
- **Dynamic Prompting:**
  - Send the final assembled context along with the user’s query to the LLM.
- **Feedback Loop:**
  - Integrate user feedback into refining future searches and chunking strategies.

### **Technical Architecture**

#### **1. Document Storage and Indexing**
- Store documents as Azure Storage Blobs for scalable and secure storage.
- Index documents in the MSSQL database using vector embeddings, tags, folder structures, and metadata.
- Utilize the new Vector data type in Azure MSSQL and SQL Server 2025 for embedding storage and semantic similarity search.
- Leverage SQL functions such as `VECTOR_DISTANCE`, `VECTOR_NORM`, and `VECTOR_NORMALIZE` for advanced semantic similarity calculations and vector operations.

#### **2. API**
- Expose endpoints for:
  - Document upload and tagging.
  - Embedding generation and storage.
  - Semantic search and neighboring chunk retrieval.

#### **3. Frontend**
- **UI Components:**
  - Folder and tag managers.
  - Interactive context builder with drag-and-drop, checkboxes, and real-time preview.
- **Search Interface:**
  - Semantic search bar with expandable results.
  - Metadata display for retrieved chunks (e.g., source, section, relevance score).

#### **4. Integration with LLMs**
- **Embedding Models:**
  - Use OpenAI’s `text-embedding-ada-002` or similar for chunk-level embeddings.
- **LLM API:**
  - Pass assembled context and queries to the LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT models).

### **Future Enhancements**

#### **1. Advanced Search Features**
- Combine keyword-based filters with semantic search for hybrid retrieval.
- Implement AI-driven query suggestions.

#### **2. Context Summarization**
- Automatically summarize assembled contexts to save tokens.

#### **3. Collaboration Features**
- Enable real-time, multi-user context building sessions.

#### **4. Multi-Model Support**
- Integrate different LLMs for varied use cases (e.g., code-specific models like Codex).

### **Conclusion**
Contexpurt aims to revolutionize how users interact with LLMs by providing a structured yet flexible platform for managing, assembling, and refining context. By bridging the gap between unstructured data and actionable insights, it empowers users to achieve greater efficiency, accuracy, and productivity in their queries and collaborations.
